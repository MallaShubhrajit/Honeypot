# Honeypot Project

## Introduction
A honeypot is a security mechanism designed to detect, deflect, or study attempts at unauthorized access to information systems. This project serves as a trap for potential attackers, allowing security professionals to analyze threats and improve system defenses.

## Features
- Logs all incoming requests and attacker interactions
- Simulates vulnerabilities to attract attackers
- Captures IP addresses, payloads, and attack patterns
- Provides analytics on collected attack data
- Optionally alerts administrators upon detected activity

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x (recommended)
- Required dependencies (install using `requirements.txt`)
- A Linux-based system (preferred) or Windows with Python installed

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/honeypot.git
   cd honeypot
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure settings in `config.yaml` or `.env` (if applicable).
4. Run the honeypot:
   ```bash
   python honeypot.py
   ```

## Usage
- Run the script and monitor the logs for attacker activity.
- Logs are stored in the `logs/` directory.
- Optionally, integrate with an external alerting system.

## Security Considerations
- Do not deploy this honeypot on a production server.
- Use a dedicated machine or an isolated environment.
- Ensure firewall rules allow only necessary ports to be open.
